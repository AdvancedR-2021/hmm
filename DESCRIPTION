Description: Implements a central "hmm" object, which fits (or simply defines) a hidden Markov model in `R`.
  If desired, the call to "hmm" will automatically find maximum likelihood estimates of all included parameters using the EM-algorithm.
  Finally, the "hmm"-class has methods for many of the most common generic functions in `R`, making use very easy.
