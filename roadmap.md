## Tentative Roadmap

### Before 1st deadline 29th of October

- Implement core functions like forward and backward algorithms, the EM-algorithm and prediction functions
- Implement the `hmm` class so that a consistent object structure can be used
- Tailor the previously defined functions to work with the `hmm` class
- Implement further functions such as prediction etc.
- Implement standard `R` methods for the `hmm` class
- Provide documentation for all of the above

### Before 2nd deadline ~9th of November

- Streamline the different functions so that data input etc. is consistent across them
- Make documentation consistent in wording, technical terms etc.
